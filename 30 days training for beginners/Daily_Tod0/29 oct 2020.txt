--finish javscript project halloween game
--lisp- truing machines
--leet code +binarysearch
--intro to apis -gameoff 2020mgo to codeagame.com and code
--visite top github contributors project in india
--view google repositur on git hub for more to dp
-- read patterns and designs

Lets follow this pattern 10-17 nov
1.think on trie
2.think on optimisation dp max out of min out of max refer the topcoder
3.optimisation dp-2 egg dropping problems
4.graph dag cycle in directed /unidirected,longest path->dijkstras negtive path think
5.np complete,hamiltonian path,tsp,euclid path,circuit etc think?
6.Sparse trees
