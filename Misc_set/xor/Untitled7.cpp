// greedy always does not work
// min coins required to make a change
//{1,2,5} by greedy if we have to make sum of 12->5 +5 +2
//{1,2,5} 12-> 3 coins req
//{`1,4,3,| 6 -> |4,1,1|->greedy  |3,3|->optimal, so greedy fails and clearly is not an optimal approach
// so we need dp
//min number of coin  problrm
